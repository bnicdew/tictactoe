# TicTacToe

Description:
This was a tictactoe game created by Bryan Nicholson-Dews that provides all the basic functionality and saves the record of the player. This entire was completed in JavaScript as an attempt to practice and hone the basic JavaSciprt skills I had acquired.

Run/Installation:
This project can be run through simple nodeJS by running the file. It will operate through the terminal and the game can be played by using the locations 1-9.

Future Plans:
  - Allow for two people to play against each other
  - Add a web element to where this could be played on a browser
  - Create an CPU AI that will make more educated decisions throughout the game or even learn off the player's tendencies
